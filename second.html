    </div>
     
    <p> If I only had to choose six movements and never be allowed to do anything else, this is what I'd choose. Please consider the fact that my proportions play a big part in this list. For me some movements are better due to my height and for example short legs and longer torso. So, here are my reasons for the following movements.</p>
    
    <h2> Squats </h2>
    <div class="boks"> Yes. I do believe squats are one of the best movements you should be performing at the gym.
      A squat is one of the most natural movements for a human to do and everyone with two legs at least, should be able to go down to a squat. Squats are not just a leg movement - they are so much more. Back and abdominal muscles play a big part in the movement too. </div>
    <h2> Pull Ups </h2>
  <div class="boks"> Pull ups are the greatest back movement you could possibly do. Best part of pull ups is that you have a ton of different varitites you can perform. In case a traditional pull up is too difficult, you get help from resistance bands or do inverted rows before moving up to a pull up bar.</div>
    <h2> Romanian Deadlift </h2>
    <div class="boks"> Romanian deadlift, also known as RDL, is an awesome backchain movement. Your hamstrings get a good strech while keeping the tension on the glutes constantly throughout the movement. It can also be better for your back than a conventional deadlift. </div>
    <h2> Dumbbell Bench Press </h2>
    <div class="boks"> Some form of bench press should be in your program. I prefer dumbbell bench press due to it being a bit more shoulder friendly than a barbell version of it. Barbell bench press is also great though. When it comes to chest movements, I think you don't really need more than one or two movements anyway - specially if all you do is sit all day in a slouched position. Then back movements are more important imo. </div>
    <h2> Barbell Row </h2>
    <div class="boks"> As I already claimed before, back movements are something you should do more than chest movements, if you tend to sit a lot. For this, I could've chosen any type of rowing but for me barbell rows give the most room for improvement. You can also alter the movement just by slightly changing hand positioning.</div>
    <h2> Barbell Shoulder Press</h2>
    <div class="boks"> Another barbell movement to end my list. Shoulder pressing with dumbbells is something I feel like most people prefer over barbell pressing. For this golden six I decided to go with a barbell version because by standing up and pressing the bar over your head, you need more work from your core muscles. If you want to add difficulty, you can perform the movement in a "knee stand", but be sure to drop the weight a little also.</div>
